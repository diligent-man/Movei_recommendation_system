Though genuine, these shots seem abstract to us. They are a rhythmically assembled ode to the light-creating devices and phenomena of electricity. Light arcs, coils, bulbs and various luminous elements support the alternation of positive and negative film images, creating an impressive universe of light and shade. In the 1920s, Pe\u0161\u00e1nek had obtained financial support for his work with electric kinetic light art. In the 1930s, he was the first sculptor to use neon lights. He built several kinetic light pianos, and published a book titled \u201cKinetismus\u201d in 1941.  \u2014http:\/\/www.centerforvisualmusic.org",

Originally titled Taranga by the original director Alexander Markey, but was completed by Collins and released as Under the Southern Cross in 1929, then with the introduction of sound was given a soundtrack and retitled The Devil\u2019s Pit in 1930. The film was shot on White Island, which has an active volcano.  It is one of four films (with Down on the Farm, Hei Tiki and On the Friendly Road) which lay claim to be the first \"New Zealand talkie\", although dubious as the sound was added to the 1930 release in the United States.  Only fragments of out-takes are left. The film probably has no connection with the 1927 British film of the same name, directed by Gustav Pauli.",

Using innovative editing, Shpykovskyi transformed an incredibly simple plot into an avant-garde work.

The Phantom falls in love with Kitty at first sight. For her sake, he sabotages the hippo (by popping and deflating her). Then he puts a phonograph player down Kitty's skirt. She walks out and pretends the recording is her own voice. Even though the record skips and, moments later, slows down to a stop (forcing the Phantom to crank the machine for her), Kitty is a hit. But does she appreciate the Phantom? No. Backstage, she jumps into the arms of Oswald the Rabbit. Enraged, the Phantom grabs Kitty and takes her down with him to the catacombs underneath the stage. Oswald goes on a rescue mission.",

Getting cold feet, the duke ducks the wedding, persuading a handsome young commoner named Bobby (Willy Fritsch) to take his place. The wedding goes on as planned, with Eva never suspecting that her new hubby is a ringer. Eventually, the false duke confesses everything, leading to all sorts of intrigue before a happy ending can be realized. Love Waltz was simultaneously filmed in an English-language version, which posed no problem for the British-born Harvey but caused a few uncomfortable moments for her Teutonic co-stars (eventually, Willy Fritsch was replaced by John Batton, who'd played a bit role in the German version).",

The star is Hungarian-born Victor Varconi, portraying a legendary south of the border outlaw who tries to force Canadian senorita Fay Wray to marry a rival rustler whom she despises.  She pleads with the bandito so pathetically that he is moved to grant her a single wish.  Without hesitation she chooses her poor but true love. The bandit king, being a somewhat honorable fellow grants the wish and without a twitch, guns down the wicked cattle thief.  Fortunately the film was played for comedy, a wise decision since it probably would have garnered laughs as a straight drama anyway.",

Then they are transported to the future, to the year 1932, when the first five-year plan is done and the commune-sovkhoz is established.

The outdoors scenes were filmed all over Eastern Ukraine and Southern Russia (Kuban): at Kharkiv factories, in Ukrainian villages and in the 240 ha-sovkhoz \u201cGigant\u201d in Rostov region, the latter representing the future after the five-year plan.",

The film starts off in the morning as these people raise the American flag and then head out to work where they do that all day. By the time the sun goes down we see how hard they work, what they eat and of course the few breaks they get with grandpa on the fiddle. I'm sure many people would be left scratching their heads as to what the point of this film was but it's also important to remember that traveling around wasn't as easy in 1930 as it is today and back then people didn't have two-hundred different television stations. So, in many ways this is an important film because it gives people the chance to see what it was really like working on a farm back in the day.",

                "overview":"JEWELS is an early example of the visual fascination of dark Vienna. The film was released in 1930 as one of the last silent films under the powerful title SENSATION IM DIAMANTENCLUB. The screenplay was based on motifs from Hoffmann's story 'Das Fr\u00e4ulein von Scuderi' (1819), which is considered the first crime story in German. Director Hans Br\u00fcckner mixes some elements of the genre in his crime film, the palette ranges from classic 'Whodunit' to detective to elements of horror film, focuses on shadows, lighting effects, cross-fading according to German and drastic wrestling matches based on the American pattern. As a 'modern' script idea, the dissociative movement disorder, i.e. the psychological paralysis of a victim in shock, impresses a motif that will later prove to be indispensable for the horror repertoire.",

Twenty years pass, and Marsh emerges from jail and establishes himself as the head of a powerful crime empire, with his daughter, Paula, serving as bait to attract wealthy victims. Paula falls in love with Lee Travers, the adopted son of Marsh's old enemy, and begins to have doubts about her life of crime. Only after a series of tragic incidents is she set free to marry Lee and start life anew. This silent feature was highly regarded for its set design and 'unusual sensitivity to the expressive range of the camera and their awareness of careful scenario construction as a key to emotionally powerful cinema'.\r Cast includes Marie Lorraine, Arthur Greenaway, John Faulkner.\r A sound version was attempted soon after but was not successful and was never released.",

The archive images are supplemented by game scenes of a German mother who loses her three sons and by trailing front scenes.  The Battle of the Somme, in which Allied troops bombarded the German front line, resulted in a months-long war of position. In documentary style, the film shows scenes of the most devastating battle of the First World War. It is narrated from the perspective of a mother who loses her three sons in battle.",
